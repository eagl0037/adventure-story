# Knock on the Cabin Door

You knock twice. The music stops. A moment later, the door creaks open, revealing an old woman with eyes like candle flames.

She smiles without speaking and gestures for you to enter.

Do you:
- [Enter the cabin](cabin_path.md)
- [Politely decline and walk away](cross_bridge.md)
